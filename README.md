# Design Patterns in TypeScript
In simple terms design patterns are practical solutions to general problems that software engineers faced during software development. All these patterns are like blueprints that we can use and customize to solve those specific problems in our code.
This project is about to give hands-on implementation examples of the Gang Of Four's design patterns in Typescript.
