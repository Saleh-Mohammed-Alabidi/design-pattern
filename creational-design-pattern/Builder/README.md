# Builder Design Pattern
The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that handles the construction of complex objects step by step (or brick by brick). It is probably the easiest pattern to spot if the existing code needs such design. The Builder pattern allows the creation of different representations of an object using the same construction code.
